   - Updated Grok API endpoint to use X.AI's endpoint
   - Updated model name to 'grok-3-latest'
   - Added required 'stream: false' parameter

## Manual Testing Required

The following should be manually tested once the app is deployed:

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Email login/signup through Privy
   - External wallet connection
   - Session persistence

2. **Wallet Display:**
   - Proper address display and truncation
   - Copy address functionality

3. **Asset Display:**
   - ETH balance fetching and display
   - USDC token balance fetching and display
   - TOBY token balance fetching and display
   - Refresh functionality

4. **Chat Interface:**
   - Message sending and receiving
   - Response rendering
   - Error handling

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the application to a hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Complete manual testing of all features
3. Address any issues found during manual testing
4. Consider adding automated unit and integration tests
