## Resolved Issues

1. **TailwindCSS configuration:**
   - Fixed by downgrading to TailwindCSS 3.3.3
   - Changed configuration files to use CommonJS format (.cjs extension)
   - Updated CSS to use proper @layer directives

2. **TypeScript errors:**
   - Fixed issues with Privy wallet address access
   - Added proper type casting for wallet accounts
   - Removed unsupported config option for embedded wallets
   - Added proper types for Privy transaction interfaces
   - Fixed VoidSigner method overrides with correct TypeScript casting

3. **API Integration:**
   - Updated Grok API endpoint to use X.AI's endpoint
   - Updated model name to 'grok-3-latest'
   - Added required 'stream: false' parameter

4. **SendTokensModal Transaction Issues (2025-04-14):**
   - Fixed "Network: Ethereum" issue in transaction UI
   - Updated transaction format to use CAIP-2 format for chainId with Privy embedded wallets
   - Changed `chainId: 8453` to `chainId: 'eip155:8453'` in transaction objects
   - Added comprehensive logging for transaction flow debugging
   
5. **SendTokensModal Contract Creation Issue (2025-04-15):**
   - Identified issue where transactions create a contract instead of transferring tokens
   - Implemented proper Privy official `useSendTransaction` hook from documentation
   - Simplified transaction code to use the Privy hook directly 
   - Removed custom transaction handling and embedded wallet conditionals
   
6. **Transaction Gas Settings Enhancements (2025-04-15):**
   - Added proper gas limit parameter to ensure faster transaction processing
   - Implemented custom gas settings based on selected speed (Slow, Normal, Fast)
   - Updated gas option UI to include more descriptive labels (Cheapest, Standard, Priority)
   - Added more accurate time estimates for transaction confirmation based on Base chain performance
   - Implemented gas limit multipliers: 1.0x for Slow, 1.1x for Normal, 1.3x for Fast

## Manual Testing Required

The following should be manually tested once the app is deployed:

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Email login/signup through Privy
   - External wallet connection
   - Session persistence
   - Embedded wallet creation

2. **Wallet Display:**
   - Proper address display and truncation
   - Copy address functionality

3. **Asset Display:**
   - ETH balance fetching and display
   - USDC token balance fetching and display
   - TOBY token balance fetching and display
   - Refresh functionality

4. **Send Tokens:**
   - Send ETH transaction on Base chain
   - Send USDC token transaction on Base chain
   - Send TOBY token transaction on Base chain
   - Verify network shown in transaction UI is "Base" (not "Ethereum")
   - Check embedded wallet functionality works without popup
   - Verify transaction history after sending

5. **Chat Interface:**
   - Message sending and receiving
   - Response rendering
   - Error handling

## Next Steps

1. Test the new send transaction implementation to ensure it works correctly
2. Deploy the application to a hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. Complete manual testing of all features
4. Test sending transactions with real embedded wallet
5. Address any issues found during manual testing
6. Add a swap feature for exchanging tokens (as per ToDo.txt)
7. Implement social media sharing feature for wallet address
8. Add onboarding for purchasing ETH for gas (Privy partner integration)
9. Consider adding automated unit and integration tests
10. Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
